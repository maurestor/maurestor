# Hi, 👋 I'm Mau_Restor.
## I love videogames, linux and programing :octocat:

I can write:
* Python (django, GDScript, game frameworks) 🥃 💻 • HTML+CSS (Tailwind, SASS...) 🕶 • JS ES (JavaScript, many scripts) 🤓 • PHP (Wordpress_plugs+themes) 🍺 🍕 • MySQL (SQL, databases...) 🗃 • TypeScript (Angular) 🕵 • Kotlin (Android apps) 📱

In this moment I'm work on two projects same time, in a game 🕹 named [mk2](https://github.com/maurestor/mk2) 🎮 and a website. 🌎

If you want to talk with me, send me a 'dm' via [twitter](https://twitter.com/mau_restor) or eMail me restor@gmail.com. • Have a nice day. 👌
